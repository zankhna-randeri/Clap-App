# Clap-App

This application uses TYPE_PROXIMITY sensor to simulate clapping using mobile phones. 

## How It Works  
User will carry phone in one hand and bring it closer to another hand. This will change proximity sensor values which will in-turn increase
background music volume. Moving phone away from another hand will decrease background music volume.
